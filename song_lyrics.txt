When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
Rolling in the deep.

When evening shadows and the stars appear
And there's no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
Rolling in the deep.

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I could never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong.

I'd go hungry I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Rolling in the deep.

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.

I could make you happy make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
Rolling in the deep.

Written by Adele off of the album "19"
