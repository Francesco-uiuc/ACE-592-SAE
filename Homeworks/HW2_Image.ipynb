    "# Fallow from the Other Side\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will examine fallow patterns in the state of California. \"Fallowing\" is when a land is left uncropped for one or more season, usually for the purpose of preserving soil health. You have two years of Cropland Data Layer (CDL), 2016 and 2017, from which to examine how common the phenomenon is in the Central Valley of California. \n",
    "\n",
    "__NOTE__: you will need to make use of the CDL documentation to answer many of these questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clip the 2017 and 2018 CDL rasters of the Central Valley to the state of California. Plot both rasters next to each other with the California shapefile. __(2 points)__\n",
    "2. Summarize the top land uses in California in each year. Specifically, make the following categorization using the CDL documentation to summarize the pixels in each year: \n",
    "    - Crops (including Fallowed Land)\n",
    "    - Forest\n",
    "    - Grassland/Pasture\n",
    "    - Shrubland\n",
    "    - Developed Land\n",
    "    - Other\n",
    "    \n",
    "  For the category \"Crops,\" make an additional graph showing the decomposition of this category in each year. __(2 points)__\n",
    "3. Create two rasters for each year: \n",
    "    - 1 if pixel is cropped, 0 otherwise\n",
    "    - 1 if pixel is fallowed, 0 otherwise\n",
    "    \n",
    "   And then plot all four of them with the shape file of California.  __(2 points)__\n",
    "4. Describe the degree of fallowing rotation between 2017 and 2018. How much crop land became fallowed? How much fallow land became cropped? Make a table or figure that conveys this information. __(2 points)__\n",
    "5. Create a raster using the CDL layers where each pixel is labeled: \n",
    "    - 1 = crop stayed crop\n",
    "    - 2 = fallowed stayed fallowed\n",
    "    - 3 = crop changed to fallowed\n",
    "    - 4 = fallowed changed to crop\n",
    "    - 0 = any other case.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Then visualize the raster on top of the California shapefile. Note any patterns you see in land use change and your thoughts on the cause of the patterns. __(4 points)__\n",
    "    \n",
    "    __BONUS GRAPH__: To submit your graph for one extra credit points, please put a markdown cell above your graph code that says \"__My Submission__\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Using the `rasterstats` package, calculate the county-level percentage of crop/fallow pixels which transitioned from fallow to crops and vice-versa. Make two [choropleth maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map) of the county-averages for these two variables. __(4 points)__ __Hint: you will need to use a keyword called \"nodata\" to correctly do the calculation.__\n",
    "\n",
    "__Extra Credit__ (1 point)\n",
    "Read in the PRISM annual precipitation raster for 2017 and calculate the county-level average for precipitation in that year. Calculate the correlation between these annual rainfall measures and the two measures you calculated above at the county level.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Suppose we want to answer the following question (__4 points__):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    __\"What effect did rainfall in 2017 have on conversion of fallowed land to crop land in 2018?\"__\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Describe how you might answer this question, specifically:\n",
    "       - What data sources you would need in addition to the data you have now.\n",
    "       - How you would manipulate the data.\n",
    "       - What statistics you would calculate or model you would run on this data.\n",
    "       - How you might present your findings.\n",
    "       \n",
    "    Finally, what factors would make it difficult to accurately answer this question? List three and explain why they might make answering the question difficult. \n"
